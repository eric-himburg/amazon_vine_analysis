# Amazon Vine Analysis
## Overview of the Analysis
An analysis of the Amazon reviews written by members of the paid Amazon Vine program was performed to see if there is any bias toward favorable reviews from Vine members. The Amazon Vine program is a service that allows manufacturers and publishers to receive reviews for their products. Companies pay a small fee to Amazon and provide products to Amazon Vine members, who are then required to publish a review.

First, a book review dataset was chosen, with reviewers given books ratings from one to five stars.  Books reviewed included all genres including fiction and non-fiction.  PySpark was used to perform the ETL process in order to extract the dataset, transform the data, connect to an AWS RDS instance, and load the transformed data into pgAdmin. Pandas was then used to determine if there was any bias toward favorable reviews from Vine members in the dataset. A summary of the results and suggestions for future studies can be found below.
